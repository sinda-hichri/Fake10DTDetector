# Fake10DTDetector
###This matlab code detects fake 10 Tunisian Dinars bills. 
This was created for my college semestrial project which explains why the report is written in french, feel free to contact me if an english version of the report is required.
You can edit the dataset and test images if you wish to run this code on a different currency
Note that all files should be placed together along with the dataset folder
